        Check the [Functionality overview](https://github.com/theworkjoy/proot-distro#functionality-overview) section of readme document to ensure that new feature would not interfere with already existing ones. PRoot Distro has a blackbox-like design style and never supposed to be highly configurable. Requests for excessive functionality (that can be achieved through already existing) or plug-in format extensions that would allow significantly modifying runtime behavior would be rejected.

        To submit a request of a new feature, fill the form below. Be patient, do not expect that feature will get added immediately.
